# classification

Modules used to classify points of interest as indoor or outdoor bin locations before manual review.

## Indoor Bins

Each foodware using establishment (FUE) should be marked as an indoor bin location.

## Outdoor Bins

The rules for labeling places as outdoor (public) bins are as follows:

(1) Wherever you can receive a cup, there is a bin. When creating a map before FUE participation is confirmed, randomly select 25 percent of FUEs as bin locations.

(2) Stores that people need to visit weekly, such as big box groceries and pharmacies, should have one return bin per parking lot. 

(3) There should be one bin per school location (K-12) or university.

(4) There should be one bin per highly utilized commuter hub or office complex.

(5) There should be one bin per public library.

(6) There should be one bin per post office.

(7) A bin should be placed everywhere there is a mail drop box.

(8) A bin should be placed at every waste transfer station.

(9) There should be one bin at every medical center or hospital.

(10) There should be one bin at every major transportation hub (e.g., airports, bus terminals, train stations).

(11) There should be one bin at the entrance of major public attractions (e.g., zoos, movie theatres, amusement parks, fairgrounds).

(12) There should be one bin per hotel with more than 90 rooms. If room counts are not readily available, use another metric as a size parameter.

(13) There should be one bin large apartment building / multi-family home / senior living center, where "large" is defined as more than 40 units or a comparable size parameter.

(14) There should be one bin per bottle redemption location and municipal recycling dropoff site.

(15) There should be _at least one_ return bin in "high foot traffic" parks and public spaces where individuals might enjoy a walk with coffee, but more could be added depending on the size of space. The design should/could mimic the placement of city litter baskets.

(16) Dedupe outdoor bins that fall within a pre-configured minimum distance of each other.
